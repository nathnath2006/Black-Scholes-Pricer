* This project was coded exclusively by me for non-commercial and non-trading purposes.
* If you use this for trading, I will not be responsible for your losses, lol.
* Feel free to upgrade and share this code as you want (mention me please).

This project was following the recommandation from CodingJesus (https://youtu.be/lY-NP4X455U?si=CAV-0b7Ty7ZHGCru) on how to build a portfolio for programming. I would recommend watching the video then looking at the code, and spending time actually searching all the concept and tools used for this rather than using ChatGPT to understand. 

Make sure to look at the requirment file before launching the code: it will give you all the specs that I used to launch and make the code work. 

Have fun fun with it !
